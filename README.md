Motivation for this project was to develop comfort using the Node.js, Inquirer and mySQL tools within a single full stack application. 
<br>
<br>
Made use of Switch Cases for CLI in order to provide UI ease of use. 
<br>
<br>
Modular in that functions can be easily moved in and out of switch cases based on changing client needs.

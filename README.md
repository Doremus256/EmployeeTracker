Motivation for this project was to develop comfort using the Node.js, Inquirer and mySQL tools within a single full stack application. 

Made use of Switch Cases for CLI in order to provide UI ease of use. 

Modular in that functions can be easily moved in and out of switch cases based on changing client needs.
